## About me


I'm Ichrak El amri,A Statistics and Data Analysis Engineering Student [at the Higher School of Statistics and Data Analysis - Tunis (ESSAIT) ](http://www.essai.rnu.tn/accueil.htm) .I'm having  several data science courses: Big Data, Computing tools for Statistics such as `R` and Python, Bayesian Statistics and Time Series . 

Iâ€™m especially interested in Machine Learning, Statistical Modelling  and Data Visualization.   For my work, I use every day `R`. I will be sharing, in this website,  many `R`  codes where I show how you can use these softwares to solve  Machine Learning, Statistical Modelling or Data Visualization problems. Your feedback, comments and questions are then very welcome. 

You will also find here  my CV,  links to my papers regarding to several to<pics and collaborations, slides of my talks and I will be soon  publishing my `R` packages.
